INTRODUCTION                                    *typedclojure*

Whenever you edit a Clojure file, bindings related to Typed Clojure are added
alongside those defined via |fireplace|.

COMMANDS                                        *typedclojure-commands*

These commands are local to buffers editing Clojure files.

                                                *typedclojure-:CheckNs*
:CheckNs                Type check the current namespace.  Any type errors 
                        are loaded into a quickfix list which is opened 
                        automatically. These mappings are valid inside the 
                        quickfix window, operating on the current line:

                        ce  show the type error message in a preview window

MAPPINGS                                        *typedclojure-mappings*

These maps are available in Clojure buffers alongside |fireplace|.

                                                *typedclojure-ctn*
ctn                     Type check the current namespace.
